# armbian-orange-pi-5-ansible
## About
This is a collection of ansible roles that I use for [Orange Pi 5 SBC](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5.html)  running [Armbian Linux](https://www.armbian.com/orangepi-5/).
Since Orange Pi 5 is under heavy development and it is WIP/bleeding edge, then re-installing the OS to test latest builds became tedious and needed to be automated.

**Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage resulting in the usage of this repository.**

If you want to help create a fork, PR or issue if you wish.
I am doing this as a hobby, so don't have too high excpectations.


## Prequesites
* Install [Orange Pi 5 jammy/legacy/minimal armbian linux from trunk builds](https://github.com/armbian/build/releases)
* Use the 6.1 kernel and Gnome desktop version. (Tested with Armbian_25.8.1_Orangepi5_noble_vendor_6.1.115_gnome_desktop)
* Complete the first boot setup of armbian (set your root password, normal user with password, build locale, network connection etc...)
* Have SSH access to Your orange Pi 5 SBC or keyboard and screen connected to it

## Installation and usage
### Option 1: Running ansible from the SBC locally
```
#Login to your SBC over SSH or use it's keyboard and screen directly on the device
ssh <your regular user>@<Your Orange Pi 5 IP address>

#Install needed tools to use ansible, git and vim(you can use nano or something else too)
sudo apt install -y git ansible vim

#Clone this repo and go to it's directory
git clone https://github.com/martivo/armbian-orange-pi-5-ansible.git
cd armbian-orange-pi-5-ansible

#Create configuration files
cp site.example.yml site.yml
cp inventory.example-local.yml inventory.yml

#Edit site.yml to your needs. Read **About roles and variables** below for more info.
vim site.yml

#Edit inventory.yml to fit your setup. Read **About roles and variables** below for more info.
vim inventory.yml


#Run ansible
ansible-playbook site.yml

#Optional, reboot the SBC
```

### Option 2: Running ansible from another host to configure the SBC
```
#Install needed tools to use ansible and git
sudo apt install -y git ansible

#Clone this repo and go to it's directory
git clone https://github.com/martivo/armbian-orange-pi-5-ansible.git
cd armbian-orange-pi-5-ansible

#Create configuration files
cp site.example.yml site.yml
cp inventory.example-remote.yml inventory.yml

#Edit site.yml to your needs. Read **About roles and variables** below for more info.
vim site.yml

#Edit inventory.yml to fit your setup. Read **About roles and variables** below for more info.
vim inventory.yml

#Run ansible, if you have public key authentication in SSH then you can skip the --ask-pass flag.
ansible-playbook --ask-pass site.yml

#Optional, reboot the SBC
```

* If the roles purpose is unclear, then check what they do from the source code
* Some roles are dependnet on others, see **About roles and variables**
* _I have not created hooks, since a "reboot" after the play is expected_
